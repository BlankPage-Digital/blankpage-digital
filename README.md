# BlankPage Digital

Welcome to the repository for [BlankPage Digital](https://www.blankpage.digital/), my personal portfolio showcasing freelance services in IT support, marketing strategies, and website development. This site is hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom domain from OVHCloud.

## About

I’m Gabriel Stanciu, a Business Administration student at Jönköping International Business School, Sweden. BlankPage is my personal project to apply academic knowledge practically, offering:
- **IT Support**: Troubleshooting and optimization.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Data-driven campaigns and branding.
- **Website Development**: Custom sites on WordPress, Shopify, and GitHub.

## Project Background

This portfolio is heavily inspired by the [vCard Personal Portfolio template](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio) by [codewithsadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee). I’ve extensively modified the original HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to suit my needs, adding custom content, features (e.g., blog, pricing modals), and assets. Credit goes to the original author for the foundational design—I’ve built upon it to reflect my personal brand and business.

## Repository Contents

- `/index.html`: Core page with About, Resume, Portfolio, and Blog sections.
- `/assets/`
  - `/css/`: Custom styles (`style.css`).
  - `/js/`: Scripts (`script.js`, `particles.js`, `translate-theme.js`, etc.).
  - `/images/`: Personal assets (logos, profile pics).
  - `/files/`: PDFs (CV, certificates).
  - `/Videos/`: Call-to-action videos.
- `/sitemap.xml`: Optional SEO sitemap (see setup below).

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Hosting**: GitHub Pages, `main` branch.
2. **Domain**: `blankpage.digital` via OVHCloud.
   - DNS: A records to GitHub IPs (`185.199.108.153`, etc.), CNAME for `www`.
   - SSL: Let’s Encrypt via GitHub Pages.
3. **Local Testing**: Open `index.html` in a browser or use `npx serve`.
4. **Dependencies**: None—static HTML/CSS/JS.

## Acknowledgments
